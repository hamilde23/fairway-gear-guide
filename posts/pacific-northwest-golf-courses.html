    <h1>Best Golf Courses to Play in the Pacific Northwest (2025 Edition)</h1>
    <p>Explore the Pacific Northwest’s diverse golf landscape—from windswept dunes to mountain parkland—and see how top public courses stack up on beauty, affordability, location and difficulty. Ratings are on a 1‑5 scale (5 = excellent, 1 = weak); restaurants and prices may change.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <article>
      <h2>How the ratings work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beauty:</strong> scenery and visual drama. Coastal dunes and high‑mountain backdrops rate higher than flat farmland.</li>
        <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> relative cost of a peak‑season round. Replay and shoulder‑season discounts lower the cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> ease of travel. Courses near major towns or airport hubs score higher than remote destinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> challenge for an average golfer. Tight fairways, severe greens and abundant hazards rate higher.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Top courses</h2>

      <h3>Chambers Bay – University Place, Washington</h3>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> Robert Trent Jones Jr. transformed a former sand‑and‑gravel quarry overlooking Puget Sound into one of America’s modern links. The walking‑only layout features sweeping dunes, firm fescue fairways and large, contoured greens. Tee shots must often run along the ground rather than fly high, and the back‑nine routing—especially holes 15–18—offers some of the most strategic golf in the region.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> demand‑based pricing ranges roughly US$100–$350 for an 18‑hole round depending on residency and season. Local residents and off‑season visitors can pay closer to the bottom end of that range.</p>

        <li>Duke’s Seafood – Tacoma: casual chowder and oysters with Puget Sound views.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Gamble Sands – Brewster, Washington</h3>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> David McLay Kidd carved this high‑desert links above the Columbia River. Wide, tightly mown fairways run firm and fast and encourage aggressive tee shots and creative ground‑game approaches. Large greens slope gently rather than severely, so strategy and distance control take precedence over spin.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> hotel guests pay about US$215–$245 for an 18‑hole round in summer; day‑guest rates range US$225–$255+, with cheaper replay and shoulder‑season discounts.</p>

      <h3>Apple Tree Golf Course – Yakima, Washington</h3>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> John Steidel’s resort course weaves through active orchards and elevation changes. The signature 17th hole features an apple‑shaped island green that demands precise distance control. Risk‑reward par‑4s and creeks on the 9th and 18th holes force players to decide whether to lay up or attack.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> the resort runs specials; discount rates in 2025 were around US$85 Monday–Thursday and US$95 Friday–Sunday after noon (including cart).</p>

      <h3>Bandon Dunes Golf Resort – Bandon, Oregon</h3>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> This walking‑only resort is America’s version of Scottish links golf. Five distinct courses hug the rugged Oregon coast. Pacific Dunes and Bandon Dunes combine tight coastal fairways, firm turf and steady winds, requiring low, controlled ball flights and creative ground‑game shots. Trails shifts inland to rolling forest terrain with elevation changes. Old Macdonald features massive greens that can turn small mistakes into three‑putts, and Sheep Ranch has nine greens perched right on ocean cliffs.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> in 2025, resort guests and Oregon residents paid US$120–$370 per round; day guests paid US$170–$420, with the second round of the day half‑price.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3>Pumpkin Ridge – Ghost Creek – North Plains, Oregon</h3>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> Ghost Creek is a public course that weaves through dense stands of trees outside Portland. Ghost Creek itself adds pressure on key holes, including a risk‑reward par‑4 17th, while narrow fairways and deceptive bunkering keep players focused. Par‑5s require careful navigation of creeks and bunkers, and the 9th and 18th holes demand precise ball‑striking to avoid water hazards.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> visitor green fees are about US$130 Monday–Thursday and US$145 Friday–Sunday in high season.</p>

      <h3>Wine Valley Golf Club – Walla Walla, Washington</h3>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> Dan Hixson’s design unfolds across rolling hills in the shadow of the Blue Mountains. Each hole affords multiple lines of play, encouraging aggressive routes for big hitters or conservative strategies for those who prefer safer angles. The course evokes the feel of inland links golf with firm turf and fescue rough.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> early‑bird weekday rounds start around US$166 while standard weekend rounds reach US$210; twilight and super‑twilight rates drop to US$111–$155.</p>

      <h3>Circling Raven Golf Club – Worley, Idaho</h3>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> Set across 600 acres of meadows, wetlands and forests, Circling Raven is a serious test of golf. Wide fairways and strategic bunkering are combined with constant changes in landscape; holes feel isolated, enhancing the wilderness experience. Signature holes include the split‑fairway 4th, the short but dangerous 10th and the long par‑3 13th.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> 2025 peak‑season rates were US$189 on weekdays and US$219 on weekends; spring and fall shoulder seasons cost US$139–$159.</p>

      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> green fees are very reasonable—about US$50 on weekdays and US$65 on weekends for 18 holes.</p>

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4>Elkhorn</h4>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> The oldest Sun Valley course opened in 1974 and was renovated in 2004. Robert Trent Jones Sr. designed the hilly front nine, while his son designed the back nine, which follows a creek with a water hazard on every hole but one. The 7,214‑yard course features over 100 sand traps and bunkers.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> public rates after 2 p.m. were US$215; hotel guests paid US$185; guests of members paid US$130. Value‑season rates start at US$120.</p>

      <h3>Pronghorn Club (Juniper Preserve) – Bend, Oregon</h3>
      <p>The resort features two world‑class courses: the Jack Nicklaus Signature Course and the Tom Fazio Championship Course.</p>

      <h4>Jack Nicklaus Signature Course</h4>
      <p><strong>Why play it?</strong> Set in Oregon’s high desert, this course plays firm and fast and was designed with minimalist philosophy. Narrow targets and firm turf demand precision from start to finish. Ancient lava rock ridges and outcroppings intertwine with natural landscapes, providing stunning views of Mount Bachelor and the Three Sisters. Holes like the cape‑style 13th over water and the uphill par‑5 15th framed by lava rock reward strategic play.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> green fees for the Nicklaus course were around US$120 for 18 holes.</p>
      <table>

      </table>

The course features one of the world’s most unique holes—a par‑3 8th that plays over a 45‑foot canyon and an exposed lava tube. Membership is semi‑private but packages occasionally grant public access.</p>
      <p><strong>Peak‑season price:</strong> green fees were about US$145 for 18 holes.</p>

      <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
      <p>The Pacific Northwest offers an astonishing variety of public‑access golf. From the wind‑swept dunes of Bandon and Chambers Bay to the high‑desert lava landscape at Pronghorn and the alpine vistas of Sun Valley, golfers of every ability can find a course that fits their style. When rating courses, remember that beauty and difficulty are subjective—what feels punishing to one player may be exhilarating to another. Wherever you tee it up, combine your round with a taste of local cuisine and the region’s craft beverages, and you’ll have a PNW golf trip to remember.</p>
