    <h1>Spokane County Golf Guide: Top Courses &amp; Nearby Restaurants</h1>
    <p>Golf in Spokane isn’t about expensive resorts or flashy gimmicks – it’s about varied municipal courses carved into forests, creeks and canyon walls. Spokane County operates five public courses that provide challenging layouts at wallet‑friendly prices. Each course offers unique scenery, from rugged canyons overlooking downtown to a creek‑side wildlife sanctuary. Below, we explore what makes each course special, rate them for beauty, affordability, location and difficulty, and recommend three restaurants nearby.</p>

      <h2>Indian Canyon Golf Course</h2>
      <p><strong>Why play:</strong> Designed in 1930 by U.S. Amateur champion H. Chandler Egan, Indian Canyon sits on a canyon wall overlooking downtown Spokane. The course drops 240 feet from top to bottom and is repeatedly ranked among America’s top public courses. Players must thread shots through towering pines on a hilly 6,255‑yard layout with undulating greens and good bunkering. It has hosted U.S. Amateur Public Links championships, so low scores aren’t given away easily.</p>
      <p><strong>Ratings:</strong> Beauty gets high marks because of the canyon vistas and skyline views. Affordability, like all county courses, is strong – 18 holes cost about US$48 and twilight or junior rates are lower. Location is excellent: the course lies just minutes from downtown and the airport. Difficulty is high due to the elevation changes and the need to hit precise approach shots into undulating greens.</p>
      <h3>Nearby restaurants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clinkerdagger</strong> – A Spokane landmark overlooking the Spokane River, this classic restaurant has served quality steaks and innovative seafood for more than forty years.</li>
        <li><strong>Wild Sage American Bistro</strong> – A locally owned bistro that pairs comfortable fine dining with high‑quality meats and fresh, seasonally inspired fare sourced from regional producers.</li>
        <li><strong>Anthony’s at Spokane Falls</strong> – Located downtown above the river’s upper falls, Anthony’s specialises in fresh Northwest seafood and produce. The cascading river provides a dramatic backdrop while diners enjoy the catch of the day.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Downriver Golf Course</h2>
      <p><strong>Why play:</strong> Spokane’s oldest course (1916) meanders through tall pines beside the Spokane River and Riverside State Park. Its gently rolling terrain delivers scenic views of the river and plenty of wildlife sightings. At 6,130 yards and par 71, Downriver isn’t long but requires accuracy off the tee to avoid tree trouble. Golfers appreciate its straightforward routing and the chance to walk nine or 18 holes.</p>
      <p><strong>Ratings:</strong> Beauty is high thanks to river vistas and mature pines, while affordability remains excellent – county rates apply. The course sits near northwest Spokane, about 10 minutes from downtown, boosting the location score. Difficulty is moderate; the course is playable for beginners yet still fun for seasoned golfers.</p>
      <h3>Nearby restaurants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Downriver Grill</strong> – A casual fine‑dining spot in the Audubon Park neighborhood serving Modern American cuisine. The menu focuses on fresh, local, seasonal ingredients and ranges from gourmet burgers and salads to pasta, seafood and steaks.</li>
        <li><strong>The Flying Goat</strong> – This neighborhood favorite crafts Neapolitan‑style pizzas with scratch‑made dough, sauces and cured meats. Toppings range from classic to gourmet – the Kiernan pizza tops an egg with arugula, cheese and Italian sausage.</li>
        <li><strong>Mary Lou’s Milk Bottle</strong> – An old‑timey diner inside a 38‑foot‑tall milk bottle serving award‑winning milkshakes, homemade burgers and sandwiches at wallet‑friendly prices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Creek at Qualchan Golf Course</h2>
      <p><strong>Why play:</strong> The youngest of Spokane’s municipal layouts winds through a valley where a creek, five ponds and wooded hillsides create a wildlife sanctuary. The par‑72, 6,559‑yard course features target‑style holes with well‑protected greens and open fairways. Its natural beauty and modern design make it popular with high‑handicap golfers and those looking for an escape from the city.</p>
      <p><strong>Ratings:</strong> Qualchan scores high for beauty thanks to its natural creek, ponds and wildlife. Pricing follows the county rate schedule. It sits on the south side near Highway 195, so location is good but not as central as Indian Canyon or Downriver. Difficulty is moderate to challenging because of water hazards and elevation changes.</p>
      <h3>Nearby restaurants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Latah Bistro</strong> – A Washington‑inspired restaurant emphasising seasonal farm‑to‑table ingredients. The chefs highlight Pacific Northwest produce and local seafood in a casual yet classy setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Remedy Kitchen &amp; Tavern</strong> – An elevated pub on Spokane’s Upper South Hill with a remodeled floor and rooftop patios. New owners curate a rotating menu featuring local favorites and locally sourced beer and wine.</li>
        <li><strong>Italia Trattoria</strong> – A regionally inspired Italian restaurant where chef Anna crafts house‑made pasta and desserts using local produce and Italian ingredients. The restaurant offers brunch, lunch and dinner in historic Browne’s Addition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Esmeralda Golf Course</h2>
      <p><strong>Why play:</strong> Built in 1956 on Spokane’s northeast side, Esmeralda is the county’s most played course. It features open spaces and flat fairways lined by more than 2,000 trees. The 6,331‑yard par‑70 layout is considered forgiving for beginners yet challenging for experienced players trying to score under par. It’s a favorite of seniors and juniors because of the walkability and friendly atmosphere.</p>
      <p><strong>Ratings:</strong> Beauty is moderate – the fairways are flat but framed by thousands of mature trees. Like other municipal courses, it’s very affordable with 18‑hole rounds around US$48 and discounts for seniors, juniors and twilight golfers. Location on the northeast edge of town reduces convenience slightly. Difficulty is on the lower side; the course is an ideal place to learn the game.</p>
      <h3>Nearby restaurants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No‑Li Brewhouse</strong> – A family‑owned brewery “born and raised” in Spokane that emphasises community and crafts beer in an artisan tradition, with the goal of bringing people together.</li>
        <li><strong>Iron Goat Brewing</strong> – Located in a renovated historic building, Iron Goat offers 20 beers on tap (IPAs, stouts, Belgians, sours) along with scratch‑made pizzas, sandwiches, house‑made sausages, pasta and vegetarian bowls.</li>
        <li><strong>Ruins</strong> – A locally owned, chef‑driven eatery that pairs craft cocktails with a rotating menu of creative bar fare. The restaurant interprets global and regional cuisines and is now located in Kendall Yards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Latah Creek Golf Course (Hangman Valley)</h2>
      <p><strong>Why play:</strong> This 18‑hole, par‑72 championship course (formerly Hangman Valley) follows the meandering Latah Creek through open meadows and woodlands. The creek comes into play on seven holes and the greens are well‑bunkered. Wide fairways invite golfers to launch tee shots, making the course fun and playable, yet water and sand demand strategy. Designed in 1969 and renovated in 2008, Latah Creek is a staple on Spokane’s south side.</p>
      <p><strong>Ratings:</strong> The meandering creek and natural landscape give Latah Creek a solid beauty score. Rates are the same county‑wide; 18 holes cost about US$48 with discounts for juniors, seniors and twilight golfers. The course sits south of the city near the airport, so location is decent but slightly removed from downtown. Difficulty is moderate; wide fairways offset the creek and bunkers.</p>
      <h3>Nearby restaurants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Luna</strong> – A beloved South Hill institution with a French country–inspired interior and outdoor patios. Some people reserve Luna for special occasions, while others use it as a place to watch football or read a book.

The décor evokes New York City bistros and Paris, with seasonal menus and meticulous attention to detail.</li>
