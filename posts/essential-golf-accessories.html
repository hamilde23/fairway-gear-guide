            <h2>Rangefinders</h2>
            <p>A rangefinder eliminates guesswork by telling you exactly how far you are from the target. GPS models show distances to the front, middle and back of the green, while laser rangefinders are more precise and can be accurate within a yard. Rangefinders speed up play, help you choose the right club and build confidence. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=golf+rangefinder&tag=fairwaygeargu-20" target="_blank">See top rangefinders</a>.</p>

            <h2>Gloves</h2>
            <p>A good golf glove improves grip and reduces friction, preventing blisters during long practice sessions. Look for a snug fit made from premium leather or breathable synthetic materials. Carry a spare glove in humid conditions.</p>

            <h2>Golf Balls & Tees</h2>
            <p>Stock up on quality golf balls suited to your swing speed and feel preference. Having plenty of tees in different heights ensures you can set up consistently for drivers and par 3s.</p>

            <h2>Towels & Brushes</h2>
            <p>Keeping clubs and grips clean is essential for consistent performance. Carry a microfiber towel and a small brush to remove dirt from grooves between shots.</p>

            <h2>Umbrella & Rain Gear</h2>
            <p>Weather can change quickly on the course. A lightweight umbrella and a waterproof jacket will keep you and your equipment dry during unexpected showers.</p>

            <h2>Divot Tool & Ball Marker</h2>
            <p>Repairing ball marks and divots keeps the course in good shape. A divot tool fits in your pocket, while a distinctive marker helps you identify your ball on the green.</p>
