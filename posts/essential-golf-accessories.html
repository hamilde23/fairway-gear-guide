            <h2>Rangefinders</h2>
            <p>A rangefinder eliminates guesswork by telling you exactly how far you are from the target. GPS models show distances to the front, middle and back of the green, while laser rangefinders are more precise and can be accurate within a yard. Rangefinders speed up play, help you choose the right club and build confidence. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=golf+rangefinder&tag=fairwaygeargu-20" target="_blank">See top rangefinders</a>.</p>

            <h2>Gloves</h2>
            <p>A good golf glove improves grip and reduces friction, preventing blisters during long practice sessions. Look for a snug fit made from premium leather or breathable synthetic materials. Carry a spare glove in humid conditions. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=golf+gloves&tag=fairwaygeargu-20" target="_blank">Shop gloves</a>.</p>

            <h2>Golf Balls &amp; Tees</h2>

            <h2>Towels &amp; Brushes</h2>

            <h2>Divot Tool &amp; Ball Marker</h2>
